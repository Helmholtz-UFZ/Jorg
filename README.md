# Jorg
A MAG Circularization Method
By Lauren Lui, Torben Nielsen, and Adam Arkin

This is a method to help circularize genomes from shotgun metagenomics data. We named this project Jorg after J&ouml;rgmungandr, <em>aka</em> the Midgard Serpent, from Norse mythology. It is an example of an ouroboros, a snake biting its own tail.
